A collection of various ML algorithms used to predict the artist of a Painting. We used 150 training images and 50 test images, resized such that the larget dimension was 500 px, while ther other was scaled down to maintain the relative ratio of the original painting.

## ML Algorithms
* Dual Structured SVM
* Dual One vs. Rest SVM
* Bag of Words

## Artisits
* Dali
* Monet
* Picasso
* Rembrant
* Turner
* Van Gogh

## External Libraries
